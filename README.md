## About The Name

I thought about the name, should be something experimental, and fun and small back in the old 
days where win95 has once inspired me and lead me into the computer world. However, I forgot the 
name about it, so I name it a near one "~~Power Toys~~Goodies" until I remmeber someday.

Names I can recall:
* Goodies
* Power Tools
* Power Toys
